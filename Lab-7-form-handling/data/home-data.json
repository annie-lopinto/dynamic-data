Nestled along the eastern seaboard of the United States, it is a place where history is etched into the very fabric of the city. The city's layout was designed by Pierre Charles L'Enfant, featuring a grid pattern of wide avenues and numerous iconic landmarks. The city's most prominent feature is the National Mall, a sprawling, tree-lined expanse that is home to world-renowned museums, monuments, and memorials. The Capitol Building, where the U.S. Congress convenes, anchors one end, and the Washington Monument, a towering obelisk dedicated to George Washington, stands proudly at the other. Throughout the city, visitors encounter historic sites such as the White House, the official residence of the President, and the Lincoln Memorial, which honors the 16th President, Abraham Lincoln. Washington, D.C. is also a center of learning, hosting esteemed universities, research institutions, and the Library of Congress, the world's largest library.
